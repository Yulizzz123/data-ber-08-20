    " - synonymous to experimentation\n",
    " - compare to lab studies (treatment and control group, placebo)\n",

    " \n",
    " Eg Study the effect of a productivity/focus pill\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. split participants into 2 groups\n",
    "  - Group A - placebo, control\n",
    "  - Group B - treatment, variant group\n",
    "  - give them the pill and measure the effect for each group\n",
    "  \n",
    " 2. Measure the difference between the 2 groups\n",
    " -> Why do we need the placebo? \n",
